## About Project 
This Project is divide in two parts one being my python code that I use to scrape all the information and other being a Power BI Data Visulatisation. The main idea to this project was to show case data cleaning with Power BI. Since this was data I scrapped myself it needed quite a bit of data cleaning. Whereas the other datasets that I found for my Power BI Project have already clean and ready to use data
